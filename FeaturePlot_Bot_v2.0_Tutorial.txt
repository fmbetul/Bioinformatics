This tutorial file shows how to use the 'generate_feature_plots()' function and explains its purpose.

The generate_feature_plots() function takes Seurat objects and a list of genes you are interested in as input. 
It generates FeaturePlots for your specified genes, sets the upper limit according to the max value of each gene, 
and saves the plots as separate PDF files in the output folder, one for each Seurat object.

Make sure you have your Seurat objects in your global environment.

# Load the function:
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fmbetul/Bioinformatics/main/FeaturePlot_Bot_v2.0.R")

# Set Inputs
SeuFiles <- list(File1 = SeuratObject1, File2 = SeuratObject2)  # List of Seurat objects
gene_list <- c()  # Character vector of genes you are interested in

# Generate scaled FeaturePlots using the generate_feature_plots() function
generate_feature_plots(seurat_objects = SeuFiles, genes = gene_list)
